# Castle-Crashers-CYOA
(CYOA = Choose your own adventure)

This read me currently will be where I plan out this game.

Story: I would like to make it like castle crashers I think. You are a knight in olden times, and are trying to get to the final boss to kiss the princess. You must buy food and weapons with your gold to defeat the bosses and eventually live to win or die trying.

As I said I would like a gold system, which you gain randomly and for killing bosses. Food will be for gaining health and not dying.

I may add a training level or 'odd job' level to earn coins without fighting bosses, just incase of buying a poor weapon, the boss is to tough, or you just use your coins to fast.

I would like to add some skill, and randomness to the game to allow for different playing experiences.

I would also like to add different paths or 'short cuts' to change how the game works.

TODO: 


-work out roadmap for levels

-Fix 'random trivia' to a sequence of questions in a row

Need to fix array and object bug with text
